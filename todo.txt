fix weird safari divs and safari font
make re-rendering more performant
why does reerender happen on resize of solve page

code review:
position of popups
.popup in tooltips.css has z-index: 1, which when the screen is shrunk lets the popup appear over the cube
errorPopup.css has z-index which lets it appear over button, why?
clicking IN BETWEEn label and input puts cursor at beginning
navbar.js should I include const inside or outside
queryformcontainer has helper function but its inside because it needs the states
how to create universal windowsize, am i creating miltiple in a weird way?
queryformcontainer lines 66-68, am i inefficient, talk about the flow

TODO:
change documentation, maybe add usage gif + diff usage gif for different size app


TODOS:
1) fix hashrouter
2) improve alg speed, then change examples based on different hardware
3) streamline process of moves for sorting
4) mobile rotation
5) mobile popups
6) M U R U R' U' M2 U R U' r' + 12 generates out of order, how is that possible
7) generating solutions button is weird padding and vertical space
