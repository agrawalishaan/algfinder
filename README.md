# algfinder

[algfinder.com](https://algfinder.com) is a fast, web-based application that generates exhaustive solutions for a given Rubik's cube scramble, depth, and moveset. I built this to make thee discovery of new algorithms more accessible, and to encourage cubers to research efficient solutions and push the limits of competitive speedcubing.
